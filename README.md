# Dogfight--now two versions
based on lovely demo by AJ Campbell, but with a lot more stuff added for those of us too clumsy to shoot down the AI jet

PlayerJet and Enemy AI Jet are based on stock Unity models (uses their flight controls), but... (the following describes 2nd version)

1) both jets are armed with 3 MGs, based on AJ's model--spacebar shoots, unlimited ammo
2) Enemy AI jet will automatically start hunting player jet after AI reaches 600 meters
3) four 747s fly around the 10 waypoints (not in AJ's version)
4) part of your objective is to shoot these down too
5) each of them is armed with an auto-aiming MG in the tail, full sphere traverse, which starts shooting at you at 800
6) but the Player jet is also armed with four guided missiles (launched by keys 1/2/3/4), which will each seek out a different 747, OR if one or more is gone already, will seek out the AI jet (so it's good if you can MG at least one jumbo).  Missiles are also my addition.
7) final addition: flak towers on each side of runway, each with dual auto-aiming MGs--they'll wait till Player jet is over 400 meters in air then have a range of 350 (beyond their own height).  Irrelevant to air combat, but you have to destroy them (with MGs) if you want to land again :-)
