# Dogfight--now three versions
based on lovely demo by AJ Campbell, but with a lot more stuff added for those of us with shorter attention spans.

PlayerJet and Enemy AI Jet are based on stock Unity models (uses their flight controls), but... (the following describes 3rd version, Dogfight 6)

1) both jets are armed with 3 MGs, based on AJ's model but 3 instead of 1, because more is better--spacebar shoots for Player jet, AI jet shoots when it's close enough behind.  AI jet turns slowly and isn't an immediate threat (in fact it's almost never killed me, vs the other threats), but if you fly straight for long enough it might shoot you down, until it's killed.  Or you can trick it into flying into the ground, or possibly enemy flak.  OTOH, it's almost impossible for you to shoot down either, except for a) when still taking off, or b) with a missile (see 6)
2) Enemy AI jet will automatically start hunting player jet after AI jet reaches 600 meters
3) four 747s (my addition) fly in line formation around a circular curcuit of 10 waypoints, each jet marked by a yellow point light
4) part of your objective is to shoot these down too--eventually I'll find appropriate bomber models, but for now these will do.  They are 1st-class-only 747s, so it's ok.
5) each Jumbo is armed with an auto-aiming MG in the tail, full sphere traverse, which starts shooting at you at 800 m--these can be quite lethal esp. if you tackle all four Jumbos at once, but even one will shoot you down if given the chance.
6) The Player jet is also armed with four guided missiles (launched by keys 1/2/3/4), which will each seek out a different 747 (at any range or direction), OR if one or more Jumbo is gone already, will seek out the AI jet (so it's good if you can MG-kill at least one Jumbo to save a missile for the AI jet).  Missiles are also my addition.  Emission trail is greatly improved in Dogfight 6.
7) Further addition: Flak towers on each side of runway, each with dual auto-aiming MGs--they'll wait till Player jet is over 400 meters up before arming, then each have a range of 350 m (beyond their own height).  Irrelevant to air combat, but you have to destroy them if you want to land again.  
8) cluster of 12 further flak towers to right of runway circle as you take off.  4 of these are also armed with coax MGs, but 3 are armed with 88 mm AA cannon (actually mounted in Tiger tank turrets, as history intended), which will track player jet and begin firing after 300 m alt (up to 2k m). These have timed proximity fuses for airburst, dynamically set to target range, and the airburst shrapnel can kill, though both range and aim are as of firing time and thus lag slightly behind jet itself.  Haven't figured out code yet to have them lead the target. But to take out the flak towers you need to aim your own MGs at them, and flying a straight course toward them for more then 2 sec or so is death.  I've been successful with some kamakazi-type maneuvers.  Spaced close together enough to take out several at once.
9) rockets -- there are rocket launchers on each side of player jet nose, which will fire up to 20 rockets (indiv salvos left-shift, full-auto in .2-sec increments alt-left).  Rockets are slower than MG fire and unguided, unlike missiles, so although in theory they represent a lot of firepower, I haven't figured out a way to use them to kill either jumbos (probably hopeless) or flak towers (in time it should be possible).  Rockets are probably more useful on much slower ground-attack aircraft, where nobody is firing back.  I have considered PAVE-type smart bombs instead, but I'm already using enough 1990s tech against 1950s targets. Eventually I'll space out the AA towers around the field, at which point they'll be a real danger at all times.
